functionalism - also called structural-functional theory, sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society.

What I liked about functionalism was that it is a fairly good relation that sheds some truth on how society functions. One of the ideas I thought about was processes in the body that have somewhat opposing jobs, but ultimately keep the body homeostatic. For example, osteoclasts create bone while osteoblasts break it down and regulate bone structure. In a similar sense, I feel society has to be willing to destroy certain aspects of itself as a means to allow change that could further strengthen it

Conflict theory looks at society as a competition for limited resources.
Social institutions like government, education, and religion reflect this competition in their inherent inequalities and help maintain the unequal social structure. Some individuals and organizations are able to obtain and keep more resources than others, and these “winners” use their power and influence to maintain social institutions. The perpetuation of power results in the perpetuation of oppression.

--what i like

For conflict theory,

pays attention to a real and fundamental aspect of the human experience as society, and especially a capitalist society, is very competitive and has been since the dawn of time. Competition is present in all of life on earth. I do believe that government and social institutions perpetuate competition, and I believe they do so as a way to keep things in favor of themselves. The big "winners" are the giant corporations and the mega-rich that can afford to lobby the government to survive and thrive, and the people in government that leverage their position in order to pass, or not pass, laws to benefit themselves or protect their assets. Every day is a competition to afford to preserve oneself and the people they care about.

Symbolic interactionist theory
Symbolic interactionism is a micro-level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within a society. Communication—the exchange of meaning through language and symbols—is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social worlds. Theorists Herman and Reynolds (1994) note that this perspective sees people as being active in shaping the social world rather than simply being acted upon. 

premises: humans interact with things based on meanings ascribed to those things; the ascribed meaning of things comes from our interactions with others and society; the meanings of things are interpreted by a person when dealing with things in specific circumstances

--what i like

What I liked about symbolic interactionist theory was the fact that it narrows in on something that everyone on earth shares in experiencing life and how those experiences shape your perception. Though it is criticised for being to subjective, there is not a human on this earth who is truly completly objective so why should we have to analyze humans objectively? Everything one thinks or feels is subjective. One's thoughts are based on their experiences and knowledge of the things around them, and the way one interacts with others is a product of their experience.
